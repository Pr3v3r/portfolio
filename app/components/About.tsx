              Hi, I'm Pravar Singhâ€”a passionate first-year AI/ML student at MIT Manipal. With a keen interest in
              technology and innovation, I'm currently exploring the world of web and app development, creating dynamic
              solutions that bridge creativity and functionality.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              Beyond academics, I'm driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence, striving to grow in coding, public
              speaking, and leadership. My goal is to not only master cutting-edge technologies but also make a
              meaningful impact by solving real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              When I'm not writing code, you'll find me working on my fitness journey, improving my skills, or
              brainstorming creative projects. I believe in continuous learning and pushing boundaries to achieve
              greatness in all spheres of life.
